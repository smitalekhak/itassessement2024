    <p> "The Dance Class" Edgar Degas <br>
        $37 million            <br>
    This work and its variant in the Musée d'Orsay, Paris, represent the most ambitious paintings Degas devoted to the theme of the dance. Some twenty-four women, ballerinas and their mothers, wait while a dancer executes an "attitude" for her examination. Jules Perrot, a famous ballet master, conducts the class. The imaginary scene is set in a rehearsal room in the old Paris Opéra, which had recently burned to the ground. On the wall beside the mirror, a poster for Rossini’s Guillaume Tell pays tribute to the singer Jean-Baptiste Faure, who commissioned the picture and lent it to the 1876 Impressionist exhibition. <br>

    <p> "The Kiss" Gustav Klimt <br>
         $240,000 <br>
         The painting contains a myriad of motifs from various cultural epochs, above all from Ancient Egyptian mythology. Most recent research has, however, revealed that it is not enough to read the ornaments in the picture just as symbols rooted in tradition aiming to convey a timelessly valid message. They reveal more, such as references to Klimt’s love for Emilie Flöge and the artist’s exploration of the sculptor Auguste Rodin’s art. <br>

    <p>"Reverie" Alphonse  Mucha <br>
        $160,000 <br>
        Like Zodiac, this lithograph was originally designed to serve as the 1898 Champenois company calendar. However, its immediate popularity led to its swift publication by the magazine La Plume as a decorative panel with the title Reverie (daydream). Mucha's design shows a dreamy-eyed young woman leafing through a book of decorative designs, possibly printers' samples. The prominent disk behind her is elaborately decorated with flowers and their stems forming a lace-like pattern. <br>

        "Strawberry Theif" William Morris<br>
        $400,500 <br>
        Morris was inspired to draw this design after finding thrushes stealing fruit in his garden. This complicated and colourful pattern is printed by the indigo discharge method and took a long time to produce. Consequently, it was expensive to buy. Despite this it became one of Morris & Co.'s most commercially successful textiles and is now his most recognisable design.
